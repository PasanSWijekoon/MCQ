# OOP I Exam Preparation

This app was adapted from [this quiz app](https://github.com/bonham000/react-quiz-app) and provides a practice testing and development environment for OOP I multiple-choice interview questions.

**[It's running live here for you to practice on.](https://mcq-kappa.vercel.app/)**

The challenges all live in the `src/challenges` directory. Each category has a separate `JSON` file which is structured similar to the other challenge seed files in the core This repository. To contribute a challenge, simply make a pull request with your challenge question(s) in the appropriate seed file. To run this project locally, fork it to your machine and run `npm install` followed by `npm start` at the root level. Now you can add new questions and see them locally. To see more details on making a contribution, please see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

We are tracking and organizing these questions in the issues on this repository. Please go there to see what progress is being made and where you can help out if you are interested in helping.
